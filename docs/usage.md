# Usage

`mcp-debug-recorder` stores debug sessions in a local SQLite database and exposes them through MCP tools over stdio or Streamable HTTP.

## Core workflow

1. Start a session with `start_debug_session`
2. Record commands with `record_command`
3. Log failed and successful attempts with `add_fix`
4. Search history with `search_sessions` or `find_similar_errors`
5. Finish with `close_session`

## Workflow: resuming a session

When you come back to an old issue, use this sequence:

1. Call `search_sessions` or `find_similar_errors`
2. Pick the most relevant `session_id`
3. Call `get_session_context`

`get_session_context` returns a compact AI-friendly summary that includes:

- the original problem statement
- environment, language, and framework
- failed fixes
- the working fix if one exists
- the last commands recorded for the session

This is the fastest way to rehydrate context into an assistant conversation.

## Updating and deleting sessions

- Use `update_session` when the title, notes, or tags need cleanup after the incident becomes clearer.
- Use `delete_session` only for permanent removal. The tool requires `confirm: true`.

## Backup and migration

### Exporting

Use `export_sessions` with `format: "json"` for a full backup payload. This includes:

- `schema_version`
- all `sessions`
- all `fixes`
- all `commands`

Use `format: "summary"` when you only need a lightweight inventory.

### Importing

Use `import_sessions` with the JSON payload returned by `export_sessions`.

Default import behavior:

- existing IDs are skipped
- orphan child rows are reported as invalid
- unsupported `schema_version` values are rejected

## Scaling

Search uses a hybrid model:

- SQLite FTS5 for recall across the full session history
- Fuse.js for reranking a much smaller candidate set

This removes the old 500-session ceiling and keeps results useful as the history grows.

FTS5 becomes especially valuable when:

- the local session history reaches hundreds of entries
- you search by fragments of stack traces or error messages
- you need filter combinations such as `status + framework + language`

## Custom database paths

To keep multiple isolated histories, point the process at a custom path:

```bash
DEBUG_RECORDER_DB=/path/to/custom.db npx mcp-debug-recorder
```

This is useful for:

- separating work and personal debugging history
- testing imports against a scratch database
- keeping project-specific memory stores

## HTTP transport

Start the HTTP server with:

```bash
npm run start:http
```

Useful routes:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /version`
- `POST /mcp`
- `GET /mcp`
- `DELETE /mcp`

## Runtime knobs

- `LOG_LEVEL=warn` is useful for CI and automated smoke tests.
- `FUZZY_THRESHOLD=0.4` makes search stricter; `0.6` allows more typo tolerance.
